### Hello there 👋🏻

I am a devoted _Pythonista_  with experience in Golang, Ruby and JavaScript.
I enjoy software architecture and good practices. 👨🏻‍💻

I rarely create new projects within my personal account, but my job at [Canonical][work-web]
allows me to work on open-source projects. You can find my contributions under my
[company profile][work-github].

Feel free to follow me on [Bluesky][personal-bluesky]
and take a look at my [personal blog][personal-blog] ✨.
