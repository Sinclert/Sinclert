### Hello there 👋🏻

I am a devoted _Pythonista_  with experience in Golang, Ruby and JavaScript.
I enjoy software architecture and good practices. 👨🏻‍💻

I rarely create new projects within my personal account, as my job at [Shopify][shopify-website]'s
Infrastructure team reduces the time I can dedicate to open-source. Nevertheless, you can find
my contributions within the organizations listed under my profile information.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter][personal-twitter]
and take a look at my [personal blog][personal-blog] ✨.
