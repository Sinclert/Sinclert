### Hello there 👋🏻

I am a devoted _Pythonista_  with experience in Golang, Ruby and JavaScript.
I enjoy software architecture and good practices. 👨🏻‍💻

I rarely create new projects within my personal account, but my job at [Canonical][canonical-web]'s
Data Platform team allows me to work on open-source projects. You can find my contributions
within the organizations listed within my profile.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter][personal-twitter]
and take a look at my [personal blog][personal-blog] ✨.
